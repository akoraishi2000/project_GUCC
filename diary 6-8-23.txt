Well this day hit differently. My biggest fear came true today. I do not know why Allah is doing this to me. Giving the the power to foresee everything and then I get to suffer twice for the same reason ðŸ˜† . I thought I got it over with Sanzida. I even imagined how I would pass my days after coming back from her marriage. Silly me. Apparently it was not over. I know this is all upon me. Only I cared for this "hierarchy" thing. I never thought I could get a fine woman like her without being in the same page. Well
